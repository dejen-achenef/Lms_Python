## Usage Examples

```python
# Initialize neural interface
from lms_platform.apps.neural_interface.models import NeuralDevice

neural_device = NeuralDevice.objects.get(
    user=request.user,
    device_type='brain_implant',
    status='active'
)

# Upload knowledge directly to brain
success = neural_device.upload_knowledge(
    subject='Advanced Quantum Physics',
    knowledge_data=quantum_curriculum,
    transfer_rate='1gbps'
)
```
